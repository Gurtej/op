        <h2>Introduction to Open Peer</h2>

<ul>
<li>Open Peer Overview Video: <a href="http://hookflash.com/open-peer/">http://hookflash.com/open-peer/</a>
</li>
<li>Open Peer Specification: <a href="http://openpeer.org">http://openpeer.org</a>
</li>
</ul><h3>Open Peer was designed with these main goals in mind:</h3>

<ul>
<li>Openness – a protocol is freely available for anyone to implement.</li>
<li>Greater network resilience – peers can continue to function and inter-operate even if servers are down.</li>
<li>Increased privacy and security – peers communicate directly in a secure fashion designed to protect against network ease dropping, forged communication or spying by 3rd parties or being a convenient data mining target for hackers as the information does not flow through centralized servers.</li>
<li>Federation – the protocol makes it easy for users on one service to communicate with users on another independent service offering.</li>
<li>Identity protection – the ability of users to easily provide proof of their identity using existing social platforms while protecting these identities from spoofed by others.</li>
<li>Decreased cost – without the need to continuously relay signalling or media through centralized servers, the costs to host, administer, relay, replicate, process and store data on servers while providing 5 9s uptime is decreased.</li>
<li>WebRTC enabling protocol – designed to be the engine that allows WebRTC to function, supporting federation of independent websites and services, provide security and online identity protection and validation, and peer-to-peer signalling bypassing the need for heavy cloud based infrastructure.</li>
<li>Scalability – whether starting at 50 users or moving beyond 5,00,000 users, the protocol is designed to allow for easy scalability by removing the complexity of communications out of the servers.</li>
